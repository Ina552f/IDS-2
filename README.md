This is a program that let's you paint on a paint like screen with whatever black objects you have at home through your webcam.

Before the program can work you need to download the following pip modules: Opencv-python and numpy.

For optimal usage of this program I recommend doing it by a window for natural light (or generally good lighted room), a white background and a USB stick. The light and background will give you the best stability for drawing and the USB has showed to be the best drawing tool. I used the back of this USB stick: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72916303/116009814-d69eef00-a61b-11eb-8998-840922fbce3d.png) 
Feel free to try out different objects or change the colors in line 12 and/or the blob detection parameters in line 20-23.

You can see a short presentation of the program in this video:
